After downloading the files, you can simply import this files directly into your Dataiku DSS. Happy exploring! ;)


## Introduction
In this project, machine learning model will predict the probability an online transaction being fraudulent, as indicated by the binary target **isFraud**.

The data is divided into two files, identification and transaction, which are linked together by TransactionID. Not all transactions are associated with a unique identifier.
